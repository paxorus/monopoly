# Online Monopoly
===
The Pokemon sprites are loaded from Bulbapedia.

## House Rules
* No 10% interest on mortgages: If a player mortgages a property for $50, they can unmortgage for $50.
* Houses can be built unevenly: One property may have a hotel, while another of the same color has no houses.
* Go: Landing on Go is just $200, not $400.
* Chance and Community Chest are uniformly random without replacement. In a physical game, players go through the deck before shuffling. This game is more like shuffling every time.
* Income Tax: The income tax is a fixed $200; there is no option of 10% of all assets if that is lower.
* Free Parking: Tax payments go to the Free Parking cash pool. Whoever lands there collects the entire cash pool.
