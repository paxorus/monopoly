* Hovering over the location on the player display should highlight the board location.
* Hovering a sprite on the board should expand the player display.
* Show the owner on the property card.

#### Rent
* property ownership (can't buy something twice)
* utility/railroads different
* monopoly doubles rent
* houses/hotels change value
* building houses

#### Code
* updateBalance() and updateLocation() should move into a Player class.
* As should the "roll" global state, it's too difficult to call now from commchest.

#### Other
* Instead of a "Hide Card" button, just have an X or Close button on the card itself.
* The Go indiv prevents hovering over the second row of sprites on Go.
* Interactive elements should have a pointer cursor.
* Chance and comm chest images.
